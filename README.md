# Tasks
A project to help me learn js as I go through
["You Don't Know JS"](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS).

The basic plan is to make the world's simplest task manager. Since I'm more thoroughly versed in
server-side programming I'm going to start this as a console program written in JS and executed
by node. Then I'll add a UI with HTML/CSS.

The idea is that I'll start with a program that barely does anything. Eventually it will work,
but the JS will be really simple. As I go through the next successive book/chapters in YDKJS, I'll
modify my code to take into account the new things I've learned. So if you walk historically through
the commits, you should see what I'm learning, and the program should slowly get better.

I'm not going to use any JS frameworks. The goal here is to learn the hell out of some JS.
